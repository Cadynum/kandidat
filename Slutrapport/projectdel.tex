''We recommend that you have one part in the report where you describe project related issues. There you can describe the purpose, goals, limitations and constraints. This part should be a clearly separated from the rest of the project which is written as a technical report with focus on information for the reader. Also, the goals you have but you never reached can be described in the project related part.'' - Jonas
